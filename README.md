# weather-app-react-native
A weather app built with React Native (my first foray into React Native!)

Going to do a walkthrough of [this](https://blog.expo.io/building-a-minimalist-weather-app-with-react-native-and-expo-fe7066e02c09).

This walkthrough is a bit outdated-- there isn't an Expo XDE anymore. Instead, you must use expo-cli. 
    `npm install --global expo-cli`

Timeline:
    March 2020-- Begin walkthrough
